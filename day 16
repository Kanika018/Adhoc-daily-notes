Network

Create new security group for ELB
configur health check ( most important setting of load balancer )
to check if a website is working properly, load balancer pings the ip of your website with http protocol to find index.html
Response Time out - > the timeout time in which the response is expected
interval - > after how much time ELB pings to website index page
Unhealthy Threshhold - > how many times ELB will try to connect with index if he got no response
healthy Threshhold - > checks for no of times to check that your page is working
*** ITS NOT FREE ***
it checks for running instance to provide you working status
using its DNS testing ip
