Notes
Amazon keeps everything stored permanently even if the connectivity with putty is weak or disturbed(gets inactive)
smallest unit of HDD is sector
1 Sector = 512 bytes
minimum size of a partition is 512 bytes always
1kb = 1024 bytes = 2 * 512 bytes
Deleting or formatting Extended partition leads to loss of all logical partitions
Formatting does not mean Deleting data , it creates an environment for HDD to be understood by OS
Windows - NTFS(New Technology File System) , Red Hat - XFS , MAC - HFS+
common format mode is FAT and vfat - - > detectable on all OS
Format makes the index of HDD, inode table entry - empty
always partitions are formatted not HDD
mkfs. - > followed by double-taps shows all available extensions for format of hdd
/mnt # forlder made in linux where new HDD directory are created but not icon
/media # forlder made in linux where new HDD directory are created with icon

Linux Commands
$ fdisk -l # no of hdd attached to linux
$ fdisk -l disk-name # shows only the hdd with disk-name given
fdisk disk-name # enter in the disk
mkfs.xfs partition-name # mkfs - > make file system , xfs - > supportable format
$ df # disk free , shows the path of new partition or HDD mounted on OS
$ df -h # path of new partitions in human readable format
$ df -hT # shows format type
$ rpm -q package-name # package available to in system
$ rpm -qc package-name # query configuration
$ systemctl start package-name # start the service of your package
$ systemctl status package-name # check the status of your services
To Create partition in HDD
$ fdisk disk-name
type print or p #shows present partition if present
new or n # to create new partition
Select the type of partition primary = p ; extended = e
select primary partition and 1 partition
starting of the partition should be taken default
+size(unit) # example, +300M creates a 300MB size partition
to create last partition just keep on using default values to use complete HDD size
Never - Ever delete or format Extended partition

if mounting an partition into an OS , the OS will create a folder at some random location and link with /tmp/newvolume which shows the icon on Desktop
Mount means creating a folder and map/link the partition

use the Command
mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/mypart
to make an icon, mount HDD in /media by making a folder in it
Make mounting permanent
* open /etc/stab
* at end write
  partition-name mount-folder format-type
* $ mount -a # checks if mounting is done properly
