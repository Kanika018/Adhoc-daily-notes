DAY 6

Notes
if permissions are not given to a user for a file the user can copy the file to another path and he will have all permissions to play with it
sticky-bit is default applied in tmp directory
dev directory is devices
etc is extended configuration
hard-disk should be purchased from same active region of service
hard - disk is purchased from EBS under Volume
Mailinator is a website where free email id is provided without credentials.
to make multiple directory at single time
mkdir -p A/B/D/H A/C/F A/B/E
By default mkdir make directory with permission 777 - umask(002)
By default text-files are given permission 662
+ indicates ACL is being applied at some file
when we check ACL permissions on a file it shows a type mask which indicates highest permission on file
LINUX Redhat
lsblk # shows partitions and hard disks in red Redhat
fdisk -l # shows partitions in present hard-disk
$ setfacl -b file.ext # Remove all ACL permissions
$ setfacl -x u:user-name file.ext # Remove single user ACL
$ yum provides package-name # it tells us which repo provides the specific package
$ yum reinstall package-name #reinstalls the specified package
Architecture (TASK)
Make two groups
in group 1 add 3 users
in group 2 add 5 users
create folders A to M as in pic
in K directory only permissions will be given to group 2
in L directory the permissions will be given to group 1
top 3 levels of architecture should not be touched by any of the groups
use stickybit and gsid
make the architecture using mkdir only once
File System Security
read = 4
write = 2
execute = 1
sticky bit = 1
SGID = 2
None = -
example
$ chmod 421 file.ext
# 421 == owner group other
all permission = 7
remove all permission = 000
add all permission = 777
read + execute = 4 + 1 = 5
 chmod  u     own     g     oth     
      special owner group   other
example $chmod 2777 /check # add SGID

User architecture
root - all permissions
group - name = Tech - has 2 users - all permission
other - has many users - no permissions
provide rx permission to single user in other * it can be done using ACL
Access control list
extended permission to be given to different users and permissions will be different
setfacl - > set file access control list
-m - > modify , user:user-name:permission
$ setfacl -m u:u4:rx file.extension
$ getfacl file.extension
to check ACL permission given to which user use getfacl

to remove ACL permission from a users

 $ setfacl -x u:u4 file.extension
Linux permissions is an important topic find out all questions related to it over google
UMASK - > changing permissions which comes by default
Storage Management
As per Student , storage is of 2 types ~ :
Primary - > RAM
Secondary - > HDD
By 2025 DNA will replace hard-disk to store data ( Project human as a storage device , 2kg DNA)
Why partitions are necessary : partitions are necessary to use same hard disk for multiple OS installations

Partition table
* No of partitions that are possible to br created in a storage depends on partition table.
* It is of 2 types ~ :
  1. MBR
  2. GPT
* in a hard disk , how many partitions can be made beyond hard disk size
* MBR (Master Boot Record) - > minimum 4 partitions are possible approximately
* GPT - > around 10 partitions are possible approximately
* partition table is made inside the hard - disk itself
* MBR does not work over 2 TB data hard-disk
* GPT has no limit or around ( 8 ETB)
* By default GPT partition table is used Windows nowadays

MBR
* 64 byte size for partition information
* Parttions are of 2 types :
  1. Primary ( 4 partition possible)
  2. Logical
* OS is installed in Primary partition
* Stores data fast, secure, easy to access in primary partition
* other then primary partition , we can make extended partition
* extended partition does not store data but inside it we can creates logical partition (60 possible) which stores information.
* total partitions present = primary + logical in reality but it shows total partitions = primary + extended + Logical
* Only single extended partition possible with 3 primary partitions
* without extended , we can make 4 primary partitions.
* maximum 2TB hard-disk size

GPT
* GUID Partition table
* Globally Unique Identifier
* No logic regarding extended partitions
* 128 primary partitions are possible

UMASK
it defines the allotment of permissions to newly created files in linux.
to find current permissions to be given to file calculate umask value by 0777 - umask around
check with file system permissions numbering
other user has umask = 0002(default)
root user has umask = 0022 (default)
