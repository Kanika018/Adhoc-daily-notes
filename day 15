DAY 15
MACHINE LEARNING
Notes
Data is all about business these days
combination of science and data to generate and valuabe data to be used in Business is DATA SCIENCE
Python cannot process more then 10GB data at once
Machine learning is logical analysis of data to accurately do your work
AI is a kind of project management (e.g, autodriving of car)
Matlab is a mixture of numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib
Collection of homogenous values is array
slashlinuxcode.blogspot.com use to study about numpy
Data Science
In this domain we have:
Bigdata -> domain to store and process , very large amount of data
Machine Learning - > an sorted data is taken from bigdata to be used
Machine Learning
A branch in which we teach something to ML and it keeps on learning using logical approach and datasets available to it

it will be a communication between user and machine in the language of maths

Libraries to be used mostly to deal with data and visualize it :

Numpy
Pandas
SeaBorn
Matplotlib
basic data structures used :

list
tuple
for
set
NUMPY
Numerical Python or numpy
library to use numeric data
its advanced version is Tensor Flow
stores and process data in the form of array
Data Processing and Visualization
its better to represent the data in graphical form rather then numerical values
Libraries popularly used for Visualization are:
MPLD3
matplotlib
Seaborn
gnuplot
Dash
MATPLOTLIB
its an open source project and we can be contribute in it
to delete a module which is imported use
del module-name
