Day 14
Today we will learn about NFS (Network File System)

We need to install this package, This package gives us a feature to use tab key to autocomplete things.
yum install bash-completion
After installing we need to restart bash service just type bash
bash
NFS Configuration
The package which provide us NFS service we use the package
yum install nfs-utils
Now we need to start the service and keep that enabled in next boot we use
systemctl start nfs-server
systemctl enable nfs-server
Now we need to create a directory in / partition which we will use to share on the network
mkdir /nfs
We can check the configuration file of a package using the command
whereis /*nfs
Using -qc with rpm gives us a list of all the configuration file.
[root@ip-172-31-9-238 nfs]# rpm -qc nfs-utils
/etc/gssproxy/24-nfs-server.conf
/etc/modprobe.d/lockd.conf
/etc/nfs.conf
/etc/nfsmount.conf
/etc/request-key.d/id_resolver.conf
/etc/sysconfig/nfs
/var/lib/nfs/etab
/var/lib/nfs/rmtab
/var/lib/nfs/state
/var/lib/nfs/xtab
need to open /etc/nfs.conf file and

Now we need to create a configuration file in /etc/exports so we have created a configuration file called exports

change folder permissions

/nfs *(ro)
3 possible permissions

ro
rw
permission,no_root_squash - > to add changes as a user

chmod 757 /nfs/
Now run these
exportfs -r is used to reload the exports configuration
exportfs -r
showmount -e 172.31.45.242 #private ip
systemctl status firewalld.target
systemctl status iptables.service
systemctl restart nfs
iptables -F
iptables works at the backend of the firewall configuration.
To force allow everything to iptables we use
iptables -F
This command will turn SELinux off.
setenforce 0
setenforce: SELinux is disabled
Now we need to mount the ip address
mkdir /mnt/mynfs
mount 172.31.45.242:/nfs /mnt/mynfs
This is used to give root access to the user who is using the NFS system.
/nfs *(rw,no_root_squash)
Now we need to entry in fstab
_netdev is used to specify that mount this device when you get networkIP, so that while in boot time this entry don't get crashed.
So first we will get systemIP then we will mount to the nfs drive.
vi /etc/fstab
172.131.45.242:/nfs /mnt/nfs/   nfs  _netdev 0 0
Check this before you restart.
mount -a
/etc/resolv.conf is a file which tells us the ip of our name server
nameserver ip-address
view-source:https://www.google.com - > shows the source code of any File
Various databases
mysql - > replaced by mariadb ( advanced version of mysql)
oracle
ms
postgre
dbz
aurora
Most popular DB engine
Innodb
MYISAM
CYS
Blackhole Maximum used language is SQL ( structured query language) speed of DB depends completely upon DB engine
Using any kind of language to use DB , we actually access the DB engine
Database to be used in our project is mariadb
MariaDB
Install Mariadb from repo rhel7
 yum install mariadb-server
start the service with enable option
 $ systemctl start mariadb
 $ systemctl enable mariadb
Database-server is setup
Port no of MySql is 3306
To connect with any server we just need an ip and port no.
/etc/services contains port no of all services
to connect with mariadb at local machine using aws
 $ mysql
MariaDB
Select - > can be used as print
MariaDB [(none)]> select "hello world";
+-------------+
| hello world |
+-------------+
| hello world |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Hash format can not be dehash but decryption is possible for encrypted databases
password can present hashformat data as
   MariaDB [(none)]> select password("hey")
    -> ;
+-------------------------------------------+
| password("hey")                           |
+-------------------------------------------+
| *4D7E5D03B1C6FED17F28E211CCA2D7FA1E98449F |
+-------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
* mariadb comes with default databases
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| test               |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
* mysql or mariadb stores all its data(Database) in
```
/var/lib/mysql
```
* database can be altered easily without query using /var/lib/mysql directory as all databases are actually stored in it simply as folder
* to use a databases(same as cd)
```
use database-nameserver
```
* to show premade tables present in a database
```
show tables;
```
To Secure mysql databases
run command
mysql_secure_installation
yes for all
now to open myysql
$ mysql -u root -p

u for user and p for password

enter password
how to crack a password for dbms
stop mariadb-server services
run command
mysqld_safe  --skip-grant-tables &
