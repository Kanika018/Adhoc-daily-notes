DAY 17
Branching @ Github
Make branches for different categories within ML-Specialisation repo
Data Processing
Computer Vision
Supervised ML
NLP
Neural Network
Deep Learning
By default every repo is initialised with a master branch
every file in master branch or every change in master branch is shown in all branches
Git Commands
git branch - > Shows the no of branches available in repo
git checkout -b branch-name -> used to make new branch and we switch into it
git reset --hard commit-sequence-given-in-log -> used to change the commit state
git push origin branch-name - > push the committed data into given branch name
git checkout branch-name -> change the branch being used
commit only after coming back to normal time

ML on AWS
launch Ubuntu 18.04
storage = 20 GB
Create new security Group with new port 8888 anywhere
Jupyter runs on 8888 by default
setup jupyter,matplotlib,pandas,numpy
to install modules from a txt file
sudo pip3 install -r file-name.txt
Supervised Machine Learning
It is divided into categories:
Classification
Regression
We need Dataset for practice
Computer system is trained(learns) using above collected Data
more data more beneficial
The computer system is able to predict the answer for question asked after its training
    [DATA] - > [COMPUTER] - > [TRAINING WITH DATA SETS]
                                       |    
             [ QUESTION ]  - > [TRAINED SYSTEM] - > [PREDICTS-ANSWER]
Parameters or attributes or qualities of objects on behalf of which a system is able to predict the answer are known as the features of that object
The object itself is known as Label
A system during training period is provided with 2 things
Feature
Label
Two find difference between objects category of algorithm used is called Classifier
Classification
classification we will be using are
KNN
SVM
Decision
Naive Bogas
Random Forest
Lion
Me and many more....
DecisionTreeClassifier
Warmup-Task
$ partx /dev/xvdf - > used to load the HDD in system just after partition
blkid - > gives UID of disk
timedatectl list-timezones -> find the all available time zones
MOTD
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -w 'model name' | awk -F: '{print $2}'
cat /proc/meminfo | grep
cat /proc/swaps
rpm -ql package-name -> shows all files and directories related to it
to download all given php packages
http://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/l/libmcrypt-2.5.8-13.el7.x86_64.rpm
yum localinstall any-ip-address-to-install-from
httpd -M - > tells all the modules inside httpd
Libraries in Linux are of 2 types shared and non-shared and shared libraries have some special reason of existence with them
permission of public_html - > chown blu
passwordless login mkdir -m 700 /home2/blu/.ssh chown blu:blu /home2/blu/.ssh ssh-keygen -N "" -f /home2/blu/.ssh/blu
cat blu.pub >> authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
chown blu:blu authorized_keys
to get private key , copy the private file to your local system
delete public and private keys of blu
