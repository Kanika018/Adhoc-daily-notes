DAY 18

Notes
DecisionTree rememebers its output
DecisionTree is a classifier not an algo
It works on the algo of ID3 and CART
Study that what is ID3 and CART and graphviz.
DecisionTree makes different cases and check the features of objects one by one
out of All features DecisionTree selects one feature and makes and checks all possible combinations
graphviz(or graphwizard) is used or can be to findout which feature is placed at the top DecisionTree
more the features, better the data
sklearn provides some datasets for learning of students
before working on any data we need to understand each and every column details
if data is huge , keep a practice of breaking a dataset into two pieces,
training data
testing data
Example: if you have 1000 rows of data break the dataset into 990 rows and 10 rows , and use 990 rows for training and 10 left for testing .
Real Data use of DecisionTree
Cancer
House Price Prediction

Type of flower
Number identification
IRIS (DataSet)
iris in itself is a plant found in ireland used for medicinal purposes
iris plant has more then 15+ categories and university of california is working on 3 of such
setosa
versicoba
virginica
it contains features = ['sepal-length','sepal-width','petal-length', 'petal-width']
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
it collects data randomly from given data set with out any kind of order

train_Data,test_Data,answer_train,answer_test = train_test_split(features,label,test_size=0.1

  train_Data = 90%
  test_Data = 10%
  ans_train = 90%
  ans_test = 10%
  because test size is 0.1
