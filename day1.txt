DAY1


initiated with a video over ways of communication , ways to easily communicate and develop a network
Application/Software -> Interpreter -> Kernel -> RAM,CPU,HardDisk (Kernel interacts with the hardware and checks for space availability. 

##operating systems @Student's point of view~:
1. Windows(Closed Source)
2. Linux (Open Source)--> its a kernel and not an OS
3. Mac(Costly)


To change backend code of Firefox~:
$ gedit /usr/bin/Firefox -> Change the Code

Kernal(3 types)~:
1. NT(Windows) ~: .exe(extension) && Examples ~ (Windows 7,8,10)
2. LINUX -> RPM(.rpm) { used for bigdata in redhat } Debian(.deb) {used for ML in Ubuntu/mint}
3. DARWIN ~ :.dmg && Examples ~ (OSX , SNOWL)


Few useful Linux Commands~:
$ mkdir folder-name{1..50} # {} encloses a range and creates 50 folder in linux
$ useradd user-name # Creates a new user
$ pinky # shows information of all available users
$ rm -f # Forcefully remove files
$ rm -fv # forcefully remove file with an action responding work done
press F2 # used to rename a file
$ cal September 1752 # shows september calendar with dates missing from 3 to 13
$ date +%Y # Current year
$ date +%A # Current Weekday
$ date +%T # Current Time
$ date --help # all options available with date command
$ cal -j # Shows Julean Calendar
$ bc # opens a calculator
$ ls -F # check which is folder and which is file in a directory
$ mkdir -p folder1/folder2 # both folders will be created together
$ rm -rf pi* # deletes all folders starting with 'pi' , use anything instead of 'pi'
$ su # switch users through command line


Default Architecture of Windows~:
1. Main Account ~ : Admin
2. Text Editor ~ : Notepad
3. CMD
4. Internet Explorer
5. .exe based OS
6. OS Storage ~ : C Drive
7. C:\user\user-name # Stores info about environment of seperate users(Desktop,Downloads,Videos etc..)


Default Architecture of Linux(Red Hat)~:
1. Main Account ~: root
2. Text editor ~: Gedit
3. Terminal
4. Firefox
5. .rpm based
6. OS Storage ~: /(backslash)
7. /home # Stores folders of different users each with seperate data
8. /root ~> Admin


Python Integration in Various Technologies~:
1 Pi (meu)python ~> Raspberyy pi
2 Web-App ~> Django,FLask
3 All Databases
4 OS ~> Linux,Windows,Mac
5 Network --> Devices (Router,Switch,etc)
6 Bigdata
7 Cloud Computing
8 .NET ~> ironpython
9 JAVA ~> Jython


To install Python 3.6 in rhel 7.5 server~ :
1. move to etc directory (using cd command)
2. move to yum.repos.d/ directory
3. create a new repo ~ > gedit adhoc.repo
4.write~ : [ad] # []these brackets can enclose anything, you can write Pykid instead as well. baseurl=http://13.234.66.67/summer19/python3 # online repository created by adhoc networks gpgcheck=0 # not to ask for certification
5. save it and run command yum install python3* -y
6. Python installed successully.


Notes:
1 Calendar used by linux is called Georgian andd other available is Julean
2 CNCF ~ : A great open source Community
3 Python is an interpreted language.
4 Python provides reusability of memory ~ > (Stores the value and not the variable)
5 Each website we run on browser, temporarily stores all its information on local pc RAM
6 (75~80) % of the data in the world is stored in string format.
7 ML and AI both uses int/float values


Data-Types~ :
1 Immutable
Python is strictly binded
examples ( int,float,str,byte,tuple)
2 Mutable *example (list,set,dictionary)
