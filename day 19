Stratis
It works on thin provision
It allocates memory on run time
2**24 filesystem can be created from single Pool
it formats the filesystem as well
dm-raid - > handles the system output in terms of storage
maximum size of Pool can be only 1 terabyte
Block-Devices refers to the hard disk
By default it works over xfs only
it requires package stratisd and stratis-cli
to get local repo for rhel8
baseurl=ftp://192.168.10.254/pub/rhel8/AppStream/
baseurl=ftp://192.168.10.254/pub/rhel8/BaseOS/

start its services by
  systemctl start stratisd.service
  systemctl enable stratisd.service

to create a Pool
stratis pool create pool-name Block-device-name1 block-device-name2

to check Pool
stratis pool list

to check block devices attached
stratis blockdev list

to create filesystem
stratis filesystem create name-of-pool-to-use filesystem-name1

to mount you can use Device name1
mount /stratis/pool-name/file-name /mnt/folder-name1

to extend pool storage / or attach another HDD
stratis pool add-data  pool-name disk-name
its fstab should be written as such that first stratis service should be up then only mount the device
pending

Machine Learning

KNN CLASSIFICATION
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbour
K is a constant value
the coordinate to be classified calculates distance value to no of K different plotted data points nearest to itself
KNN works on Ecludien Distance Algorithm
the one with maximum points marked from nearby points is classified as answer
this method is too slow and fails for very huge amount of data

Working
Find the distance from each point for the test point and sort them out to find the least distant points
the value of K should be odd and not 1 that is 3,5,7,9,...(RECOMMENDATION NOT COMPULSORY)
It can be used for the purpose of Regression as well

Regression
It is used when we have to find some specific value depending upon the features and values given
it uses linear graphical line plot to predict the value

it has many categories :
Linear Regression ( y = mx + c)
Polynomial Regression ( y = ax1 + a1x2**2 + a2x3**2)
Logistic Regression

SVM & SVR
Support Vector Machine used in Classification
Support Vector Regression used in Regression
SVM creates a common support vector between two objects and analyze the new object based on location of new object
