DAY 12

Notes ~
RSA is algorithm used for data encryption
https is made using RSA algorithm
RSA creates a key for security reasons ( in form of encrypted text(random data))
KEY is only sent once not again
SSL ( Secure Socket Layer) - > TLS (Transport Layer Security)
http - > https ( from above point)

Ansible
it can automate work with :

Linux ( using SSH)
Cloud
Network (API) - > CISCO (networking company)
Docker (GO API)
Window (uses WINRM protocol to connect Ansible with windows)
while using ANSIBLE use a key not a password

Install Ansible on LINUX by add a repo in adhoc.repo

  $ yum install ansible
it is made using python ( a module)

working with ANSIBLE
1. connect two different instances
2. ansible need to be installed in one OS
3. ansible is not required in instance where we want to do somework on
4. Assign password to ec2-user in OS 2
5. Change /etc/ssh/sshd.config to accept password in OS2
6. Restart sshd service
7. open /etc/ansible
8. open ansible's inventory file
```
 $ nano /etc/ansible/hosts
```
7. define the ip address of second instance in this file
at the top
```
[a]
ip-address
```
8. run command

```
$ ansible a -u ec2-user -m ping --k

-m stand for module
-k stand for password
-u stand for user
 a is the group name where all ip can be stored
```
Create a RSA key
RUN Following Commands
$ ssh-keygen
$ enter-file-name(or just enter)
$ set password on above file( or just enter)
 retype password
key is made on ANSIBLE
priavate key is saved on OS1 and public is send to OS 2
to send public key
$ ssh-copy-id OS2-username@OS2-ip

Hacking - > UDP Message interception
in socket programming sender ip or port are never required at both sender or receiver side
it can be done using MITM that is 'man in the middle attack'
Cryptography
It is the encryption and decryption of data

it is of 2 types:
Symmetric works on AES and DES
Asymmetric works on RSA,DSA,ECDSA
Symmetric Cryptography uses single key for encryption and decryption of data
Symmetric key can not be hacked but access to it was possible earlier
to prevent above problem, Asymmetric Cryptography was developed
key - pair are developed in Asymmetric cryptography , one is private 
key and other one is public key where each is a key for other one that is public is used to open private and private to open public
